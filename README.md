Is serverless file uploading manager built on React + Redux and FireBase, that allows to upload images on FireBase.

## Instalation

## Overview
File uploader allows to upload files only in `.jpg, .png, .jpeg, .gif` file formats, so it is made only for pictures.
There is no need in FireBase configuration, I've already done it, so be free to upload your pictures using this app.
If you want to use your own FireBase, then just replace content of `firebase.config.js` with your newly generated.
